# Serverless Dynamic Pricing

A cloud-native dynamic pricing engine built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This project demonstrates how to implement a scalable, event-driven architecture that adjusts prices in real-time based on demand signals. Please have a look at our paper as we take a deeper dive into the topic.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes AWS Lambda functions for compute operations, reducing infrastructure management overhead.
- **DynamoDB Storage**: Stores pricing data and demand metrics for quick retrieval and scalability.
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Adjusts product prices dynamically in response to real-time demand data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
