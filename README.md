# Serverless Dynamic Pricing

A cloud-native dynamic pricing engine built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This project demonstrates how to implement a scalable, event-driven architecture that adjusts prices in real-time based on demand signals.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes AWS Lambda functions for compute operations, reducing infrastructure management overhead.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the pricing engine.
- **DynamoDB Storage**: Stores pricing data and demand metrics for quick retrieval and scalability.
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Adjusts product prices dynamically in response to real-time demand data.
